# Security Hardening Summary

This document summarizes the security improvements made to the Spark 3.5 Docker image following Docker security best practices.

## Implemented Security Improvements

### 1. Multi-Stage Builds ✅
**Implementation:**
- Separated the build process into two stages:
  - **Builder stage**: Downloads and extracts Spark with minimal tools (wget, ca-certificates)
  - **Runtime stage**: Contains only runtime dependencies

**Benefits:**
- Reduced final image size by excluding build tools
- Smaller attack surface (no wget, tar, or other build utilities in final image)
- Faster image pulls and deployments

**Reference:** Dockerfile lines 1-23 (builder stage) and 25-99 (runtime stage)

### 2. Minimal Runtime Dependencies ✅
**Implementation:**
- Used `--no-install-recommends` flag with apt-get
- Switched from `openjdk-11-jdk` (full JDK) to `openjdk-11-jre-headless` (runtime only)
- Removed wget from runtime image
- Cleaned up apt cache and lists after installation

**Benefits:**
- Reduced image size by ~200-300MB
- Fewer packages means fewer potential vulnerabilities
- No compilers or development tools in final image

**Reference:** Dockerfile lines 44-53

### 3. Non-Root User ✅
**Implementation:**
- Created dedicated `spark` user and group (UID/GID 1001)
- All Spark processes run as non-root user
- All files and directories owned by spark user
- Set `USER spark` directive before ENTRYPOINT

**Benefits:**
- Limits damage if container is compromised
- Prevents privilege escalation attacks
- Follows principle of least privilege

**Reference:** Dockerfile lines 62-65, 95

### 4. Proper File Permissions ✅
**Implementation:**
- Created all directories with proper ownership during build
- Used `--chown=spark:spark` when copying files
- Set appropriate execute permissions on scripts

**Benefits:**
- Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive files
- Ensures spark user can only access necessary files
- Reduces risk of privilege escalation

**Reference:** Dockerfile lines 67-82

### 5. Build Context Optimization ✅
**Implementation:**
- Created `.dockerignore` file
- Excluded git files, documentation, virtual environments, IDE files
- Prevents sensitive files from being included in build context

**Benefits:**
- Faster build times
- Prevents accidental inclusion of secrets or sensitive data
- Smaller build context size

**Reference:** `.dockerignore` file

### 6. Documentation ✅
**Implementation:**
- Added comprehensive security section to README
- Documented vulnerability scanning with Trivy and Grype
- Included image signing guidance (Docker Content Trust, Cosign)
- Added guidance on keeping images updated

**Benefits:**
- Users understand security features
- Easy to scan for vulnerabilities
- Clear guidance on production use

**Reference:** README.md Security Hardening section

## Security Checklist Compliance

Based on the provided recommendations:

| Recommendation | Status | Implementation |
|---------------|--------|----------------|
| Use minimal base images | ✅ | Ubuntu 22.04 with --no-install-recommends |
| Remove unnecessary tools | ✅ | No wget, tar, compilers in runtime; JRE instead of JDK |
| Run as non-root user | ✅ | spark user (UID/GID 1001) |
| Keep images updated | ✅ | Documented rebuild process and monitoring |
| Use multi-stage builds | ✅ | Separate builder and runtime stages |
| Scan for vulnerabilities | ✅ | Documented Trivy and Grype usage |
| Set permissions properly | ✅ | All files owned by spark user with correct permissions |
| Sign and verify images | ✅ | Documented Docker Content Trust and Cosign |

## Comparison: Before vs After

### Image Size
- **Before**: ~1.5GB (estimated with full JDK and build tools)
- **After**: ~1.2GB (estimated with JRE only and no build tools)

### Security Posture
- **Before**: Runs as root, includes build tools, full JDK
- **After**: Runs as non-root, minimal runtime dependencies, JRE only

### Attack Surface
- **Before**: Compilers, build tools, shells available to root user
- **After**: Minimal runtime packages, no build tools, non-root user

## Verification Steps

To verify the security improvements:

1. **Check user context:**
```bash
docker run --rm spark-3.5:latest whoami
# Should output: spark
```

2. **Verify no wget in runtime:**
```bash
docker run --rm spark-3.5:latest which wget
# Should fail or return empty
```

3. **Check file ownership:**
```bash
docker run --rm spark-3.5:latest ls -la /opt/spark
# Should show spark:spark ownership
```

4. **Scan for vulnerabilities:**
```bash
docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  aquasec/trivy image spark-3.5:latest
```

## Future Improvements

Consider these additional security enhancements:

1. **Rootless containers**: Run Docker daemon in rootless mode
2. **Read-only root filesystem**: Add `--read-only` flag with tmpfs mounts
3. **Capability dropping**: Use `--cap-drop=ALL` and add only required capabilities
4. **Security profiles**: Implement AppArmor or SELinux profiles
5. **Network policies**: Restrict network access at orchestration layer
6. **Image signing**: Implement mandatory image signing in production
